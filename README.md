# projRemote
Made with OpenFrameworks.
This is a custom software for operating the Video and Public Announcement system in the main hall of Vicenza's City Theatre.

The software is controlled via an Arduino (check the "ProjKeyboard" folder) and it can turn on and off the video projector through the PJLink protocol.
